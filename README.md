# TranslatorApp
# Overview

This mobile app allows a user to type in a word and have it translated. 

The language translation app gives the user three text input options. First the user types in the word or words they wish to have translated. Then they type which language (source language) they are starting with. Next, they type in which language they want to translate to (target language). Then they hit enter and the results are displayed. 

This app's purpose is to provide knowledge of how to say a word in a lanuage that is different from someone's native tongue.
